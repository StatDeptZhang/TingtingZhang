<p>My research interests lie mainly in the multidisciplinary fields of human brain mapping and computational
neuroscience. Specifically, my research is focused on developing efficient and robust statistical
methods for analyzing brain data and using these methods to investigate normal and abnormal functional
organizations of the brain. The new methods that I have developed are in three major statistical fields:
Bayesian inference, network analysis, and high-dimensional data.</p>

<p>Due to recent advances in technology, enormous quantities of brain data in various modalities
have been produced in many fields, including biology, neurology, neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry.
However, brain data, one of the most commonly cited forms of big data, raise new challenges to
data analysts, due to their unique properties that are different from conventional data. To address these
challenges, I have led several projects in close collaboration with scientists outside statistics to develop new
statistical models and computational algorithms for analyzing brain data. 
	
	
<h4>(1) Brain Network Studies of Epileptic Seizures Using Intracranial EEG Data.</h4>
	The overall goals of my research are to develop new statistical modeling methods for analyzing
high-dimensional brain data and use the methods to understand high-dimensional directed networks in
human brains. Specifically, my research team develops high-dimensional directed network methods for
analyzing intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. The iEEG data record 50-150 sites of intracranial brain electrical
activity of patients with epilepsy by using cortical or depth electrodes. We analyze these iEEG data to study
directed brain networks because in epilepsy, the propagation of seizures from a seizure onset zone (SOZ)
to other healthy brain regions is a clinically important example of pathological directed brain networks.

We obtained several significant results regarding brain network changes of patients with epilepsy. (1) The directed brain
networks of patients with epilepsy have little variation across time before seizure onset, while they exhibit
dramatic changes at seizure onset time. The changes in the brain networks occur mainly around the SOZ.
We found that, after seizure onset, the numbers of directed connections of the SOZ and regions in the SOZ
cluster increase significantly. (2) We revealed different patterns of brain network changes during seizure development
for different epilepsy types. (3) The SOZ has the highest increase in directed connectivity at the seizure
onset time. (4) By utilizing this special connectivity property of the SOZ, we have developed quantitative
methods to localize the SOZ with high accuracy. The following two videos illustrate 
different patterns of brain network changes during seizure development for different 
epilepsy types.

EEG data. Nodes in light blue are the regions that did not belong to any clusters. Nodes in the same other colors (either dark blue, green, pink, red, purple, brown or yellow)
denote different identified clusters of regions. All nodes in red color belong to the SOZ cluster. Grey arrows indicate the identified directional connections between regions.

 <h4>(2) Whole-Brain Network Analysis of Massive Neuroimaging Data. </h4>
The functional organization of the brain is governed by two principles: functional
specialization and functional integration. The former indicates that
different brain areas are specialized for different brain functions, while the latter
suggests different brain areas interact with each other to process information and
perform various functions. The modular organization of the brain
(also called modularity) of networks is tied with functional specialization
and integration. Specifically, the brain network comprises modules of brain regions,
whose connections with regions in the same module are stronger and denser than
connections with regions in different modules. Brain regions in the same module
tend to be specialized for the same or similar functions. Directed connections within
and between modules ensure integration among different functionally specialized
brain areas.

We developed a new variational Bayesian method to identify functionally specialized modules and directed connections between and within modules while addressing computational challenges in analyzing massive fMRI data. We obtained several results from the directed network analysis of fMRI data. First, the modules identified by our method are accordant with functional brain systems specialized for various functions. Second, we revealed that large functional systems consist of several functional subdivisions (i.e., small modules) with different densities of directed connections. Moreover, the identified small modules overlap with anatomical subdivisions of these functional systems. Third, the most considerable variation in directed brain networks across subjects
lies in between-module directed connections.

<p>We examined population-wide brain responses to designed negative emotional stimuli under different social contact 
	conditions and located the anterior portion of dACC (adACC) to be responsive to the stimuli. adACC plays an important role 
	in appraising and expressing negative emotion and is involved in regulating amygdala's affective response to fear. Our 
	analysis confirms heterogeneous emotional functions of dACC subregions. </p>
<p>We also detected responses to negative emotional stimuli in the white matter corpus callosum, in line with a growing body 
	of evidence on fMRI activation in white matter, especially in the corpus callosum. Our method potentially has captured 
	the white matter activity in a data-driven manner and has potential to be used for further investigations of white matter 
	and gray matter brain functions.</p>
